# Java-Money-Conversion
A simple Money Converter in Java 

To get started you will be given a list of 4 common currencies to Convert from CAD (Canadian Dollars) to either JPY (Yen) or even GBP ( Pound Sterling ).

Once your selection of either 1, 2, 3, or 4 is made you are then prompted to input an amount ie: 1 or 5.75.

The program will then take your inputted amount and depending on which you chose it will divide or multiply a set amount (Which was the current conversion at the time).

Once the conversion is made it will then print the inputted amount and the converted amount with the said logo for currency.
